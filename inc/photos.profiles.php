        Lucky lives in the northern region of Malawi, where he is a peer educator. He has many gay friends and says it’s easy to spot another gay man. Once he figures out that someone is a man who has sex with men, he will approach him, maybe in a bar, become his friend and then bring up his role and confirm the man’s orientation. That’s how he builds his network and spreads HIV-related messages.
